# OZHI-AWDS

A database program to modernize the AWDS program to work with our OZHI inspectors.
The program should be lightweight and powerful.  The UI should be easy to navigate.
The database being used is SQLite for the power and compactness.  WPF will be used
for the UI because of the legacy of the reports being viewed and to keep the reports
looking the same as AWDS.
